What did I learn?

Fourth day
I'am using input and variables to get user information and store that.
Also I've learned how to add color in print structure like,
Syntax: Escape codes begin with \033[ followed by a code and ending with m

print('\033[31mDalton\033[0m Soares')
Where \033 is the escape code and
31m and 0m is the color as 31=red, 0=default.
